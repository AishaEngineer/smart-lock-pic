# Smart Lock System 🔐

## Description
This project is a Smart Lock system implemented using a PIC microcontroller.
The system aims to enhance security by controlling access through programmed logic
and hardware components.

## Technologies & Tools
- Embedded C
- PIC Microcontroller
- Microcontroller peripherals
- Basic security concepts

## My Role
- Writing embedded C code
- Interfacing hardware components
- Testing and debugging the system

## Notes
The source code and hardware schematics are not publicly available.
This repository is created for academic and documentation purposes.
